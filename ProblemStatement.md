**Problem Statement**

The system to be built is a Library Management System. A Library for our definition is a collection of titles which can be borrowed and returned to the system. It is possible to have multiple copies of the same title available. The system is available only to registered users and there is a limit on the number of titles that a user can hold in any time period. If a user is holding a title it is no longer accessible to other users until returned.

The Manager of the system should be able to add and remove titles and see reports on the status of the available titles. Registered users should be able to see which titles are available for borrowing and which titles they already hold.

**PROBLEM**

With the increasing size of libraries and demand for effective ways to organise the Library Management system, the need for new tracking systems has increased very much. Most of the currently maintained procedures are manual, time-consuming and inefficient. The physical recording process results in lots of manual work, extreme amount of wasted paper and also occupies lot of physical space that will be so mundane to maintain in long run and it is also very difficult to track back the record history.


**PROPOSAL**

Through this project we are planning to build a system called BOOKbible (Book Management System). Book Bible attempts to reduce the paper usage by introducing the Software Application for managing the book tracking system.
The process of developing and managing the BOOKbible itself consists of three main activities:
1)	Authorising the software to enter/modify the record information of every book
2)	Storage of this information in a database and
3)	Authorising the software to track the book lending history by providing the book exchange time stamps
This software is intended to provide secure maintenance of the records by providing an option of password protected access to the authorized personnel.


**FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:**

The BOOKbible Application should support the following functions:
•	Password protected login access to the user
•	User should have the option to Add/delete books
•	View/Edit/Search from the book’s record
•	Issue the books to other users


**NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:**

When designing BOOKbible, the following constraints should be taken into account:
•	User-friendly interface of the application
•	Any functionality included as part of developing this application must be platform independent
•	The application must always be available to the user to be accessed locally 
SYSTEM LIMITATIONS:
When designing BOOKbible, the following will be true of the developed application:
•	The BOOKbible application is a management system. Any use otherwise is not supported
•	BOOKbible will not be able to detect technical errors in the Book entry details. Therefore, any errors that existed prior to the digitization process will still exist in the BOOKbible system


**DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT:**

It is expected that the development environment requires the Operating system Windows 7 or above version and also a C. . . . . . . 
The BOOKbible application will run on desktop machines.
1.	IDE
2.	Compiler
3.	Database (to store books records ) - TBD


**ACCEPTANCE TEST**

The BOOKbible application in working status that covers all the functional and non-functional requirements that are mention in the above sections. Additional functionalities added in the design phase will also be considered as part of developing the application.
