**PROBLEM**

With the increasing size of libraries there is a demand for effective ways to organise and track the lending processes. Most of the currently maintained procedures are manual, time-consuming and inefficient. Manual/Physical recording processes result in lots of tedious work, extreme amount of wasted paper and also occupies lot of physical space that will be difficult to maintain in long run. Additionally they present challenges with retrieving records.

**PROPOSAL**

Through this project we aim to build a library management system called BOOKIFY. BOOKIFY attempts to reduce the paper usage by utilizing software to manage library processes.

The process of developing and managing the BOOKIFY consists of three main activities:

1.  Authorising the software to enter/modify the record information of books, and register users 
2.  Storage of this information in a database and
3.  Authorising the software to track the book lending process 

This software is intended to provide secure maintenance of the records by providing password protected access to the registered users.

**FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:**

BOOKIFY should support the following functions:

1.  Password protected login access to registered users
2.  Manager should have the option to Add/delete books
3.  Registered users should be able to View/Search the book records
4.  Registered users should be able to borrow and return books

**NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:**

When designing BOOKIFY, the following constraints will be taken into account:

1.  User-friendly interface of the application
2.  Any functionality included as part of developing this application must be platform independent

**SYSTEM LIMITATIONS:**

When designing BOOKIFY, the following will be true of the developed application:

1.  The BOOKIFY application is a management system. Any use otherwise is not supported
2.  BOOKIFY will not be able to detect technical errors in the Book entry details. Therefore, any errors that existed prior to being entered into the application will still exist in the BOOKIFY system

**DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT:**

It is expected that the development environment requires the Operating system Windows 7 or above. 

1.  IDE
2.  Compiler
3.  Database (to store books records ) -- TBD

The BOOKIFY application will run on desktop machines

**ACCEPTANCE TEST**

The BOOKIFY application in working status that covers all the functional and non-functional requirements that are mention in the above sections. Additional functionalities added in the design phase will also be considered as part of developing the application.

**FEATURES LISTED BY PRIORITY **

**Release 1:**

1.  Add/Remove/Edit Books
2.  Register User with Login and Password
3.  Check Book availability status
4.  Issue/Borrow Book

**Release 2:**

1.  Display all users details
2.  Search/Display Book details
3.  TBD
