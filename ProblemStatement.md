**Problem Statement**

The system to be built is a Library Management System. A Library for our definition is a collection of titles which can be borrowed and returned to the system. It is possible to have multiple copies of the same title available. The system is available only to registered users and there is a limit on the number of titles that a user can hold in any time period. If a user is holding a title it is no longer accessible to other users until returned.

The Manager of the system should be able to add and remove titles and see reports on the status of the available titles. Registered users should be able to see which titles are available for borrowing and which titles they already hold.
